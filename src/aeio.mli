(** Asynchronous effect-based IO

(** {1 Aeio} *)

type file_descr = Unix.file_descr
type sockaddr = Unix.sockaddr
type msg_flag = Unix.msg_flag

type 'a promise
(** The type of promise. *)

type context 
(** The type of cancellation context. *)

exception Cancelled
(** Raised in the cancelled fiber. Allows the fiber to dispose resources
    cleanly. *)

exception Promise_cancelled
(** Raised at {!await} if the promise was cancelled. *)

val new_context : unit -> context 
(** Creates a new cancellation context. *)

val my_context : unit -> context
(** Return the current cancellation context. *)

val cancel : context -> unit
(** Cancel the context. *)

val async : ?ctxt:context-> ('a -> 'b) -> 'a -> 'b promise
(** [async f v] spawns a fiber to run [f v] asynchronously. If no cancellation
    context was provided, then the new fiber shares the cancelallation context
    of the caller. *)

val await : 'a promise -> 'a 
(** Block until the result of a promise is available. Raises exception [e] if
    the promise raises [e]. 
    @raise Promise_cancelled if the promise was cancelled. *)

val yield : unit -> unit
(** Yield control. *)

val accept : file_descr -> file_descr * sockaddr
(** Similar to Unix.accept, but asynchronous. *)

val recv : file_descr -> bytes -> int -> int -> msg_flag list -> int
(** Similar to Unix.recv, but asynchronous. *)

val send : file_descr -> bytes -> int -> int -> msg_flag list -> int
(** Similar to Unix.send, but asynchronous. *)

val sleep : float -> unit
(** [sleep t] suspends the fiber for [t] milliseconds. *)

val run : (unit -> unit) -> unit
(** Run the asynchronous program. *)
